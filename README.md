# The Starling Manual

The goal of this manual is to provide an extensive introduction to the [Starling Framework][1].
Starling is a cross-platform engine for _ActionScript 3_ that can be used for all kinds of applications, with a special focus on 2D games.

This repository provides the basis for the [English online manual][2].
It is written in the [AsciiDoc][3] markup language and can be easily compiled into HTML, PDF and EPUB.
Have a look at the `BUILD.md` file to find out how to compile the source yourself.
