== Dynamic Text
ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: ../../img]

Text is an important part of every application.
You can only convey so much information with images; some things simply need to be described with words, dynamically at run-time.

=== TextFields

Starling makes it easy to display dynamic text.
The _TextField_ class should be quite self explanatory!

[source, as3]
----
var textField:TextField = new TextField(100, 20, "text"); // <1>
textField.format.setTo("Arial", 12, Color.RED); // <2>
textField.format.horizontalAlign = Align.RIGHT; // <3>
textField.border = true; // <4>
----
<1> Create a TextField with a size of 100×20 points, displaying the text "text".
<2> We set the format to "Arial" with a size of 12 points, in red.
<3> The text is aligned to the right.
<4> The border property is mainly useful during development: it will show the boundaries of the TextField.

NOTE: Note that the style of the text is set up via the `format` property, which points to a `starling.text.TextFormat` instance.

Once created, you can use a _TextField_ just like you'd use an image or quad.

=== TrueType Fonts

Per default, Starling will use system fonts to render text.
For example, if you set up your TextField to use "Arial", it will use the one installed on the system (if it is).

However, the rendering quality of that approach is not optimal; for example, the font might be rendered without anti-aliasing.

For a better output, you should embed your _TrueType_ fonts directly into the SWF file.
Use the following code to do that:

[source, as3]
----
[Embed(source="Arial.ttf", embedAsCFF="false", fontFamily="Arial")]
private static const Arial:Class; // <1>

[Embed(source="Arial Bold.ttf", embedAsCFF="false", fontFamily="Arial", fontWeight="bold")]
private static const ArialBold:Class; // <2>

[Embed(source="Arial Italic.ttf", embedAsCFF="false", fontFamily="Arial", fontStyle="italic")]
private static const ArialItalic:Class; // <3>

[Embed(source="Arial.ttf", embedAsCFF="false", fontFamily="Arial", unicodeRange = "U+0020-U+007e")]
private static const ArialJustLatin:Class; // <4>
----
<1> Embedding the standard _Arial_ font. Note the _embedAsCFF_ part: don't skip it! Otherwise, the font simply won't show up.
<2> Bold and italic styles must be embedded separately. Note the _fontWeight_ attribute here,
<3> and the _fontStyle_ attribute here.
<4> You can also define which glyphs to include, which is useful for big fonts when you don't need all _Unicode_ letters.
    The range shown here is for basic Latin (upper- and lowercase chars, numerals and common symbols/punctuations).

After embedding the font, any TextField that is set up with a corresponding font name (font family) and weight will use it automatically.
There's nothing else to set up or configure.

TIP: Beware of the big footprint when embedding all glyphs of a font.
The "unicodeRange" shown above mitigates this problem. You can generate the ranges using e.g. http://renaun.com/blog/2011/10/flash-embed-font-unicode-range-generator[Unicode Range Generator].

TIP: If your text is clipped or does not appear at the correct position, have a look at your current `stage.quality` setting.
A low quality value often causes Flash/AIR to report incorrect values regarding the text bounds, and Starling depends on those values when it draws the text.
(I'm talking about the Flash stage here; and this applies only to TrueType fonts.)

=== Bitmap Fonts

Using _TrueType_ fonts as shown above is adequate for text that does not change very often.
However, if your TextField constantly changes its contents, or if you want to display a fancy font that's not available in TrueType format, you should use a bitmap font instead.

A bitmap font is a texture containing all the characters you want to display.
Similar to a _TextureAtlas_, an XML file stores the positions of the glyphs inside the texture.

This is all Starling needs to render bitmap fonts.
To create the necessary files, there are several options:

* http://kvazars.com/littera/[Littera], a full-featured free online bitmap font generator.
* http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/[Bitmap Font Generator], a tool provided by AngelCode that lets you create a bitmap font out of any TrueType font. It is, however, only available for Windows.
* http://glyphdesigner.71squared.com[Glyph Designer] for _macOS_, an excellent tool that allows you to add fancy special effects to your fonts.
* http://www.bmglyph.com[bmGlyph], also exclusive for _macOS_, available on the App Store.

The tools are all similar to use, allowing you to pick one of your system fonts and optionally apply some special effects.
On export, there are a few things to consider:

* Starling requires the XML variant of the `.fnt` format.
* Make sure to pick the right set of glyphs; otherwise, your font texture will grow extremely big.

The result is a `.fnt` file and an associated texture containing the characters.

.A bitmap font that has color and drop shadow included.
image::desyrel-font.png[Bitmap Font, 400, pdfwidth='9cm']

To make such a font available to Starling, you can embed it in the SWF and register it at the TextField class.

[source, as3]
----
[Embed(source="font.png")]
public static const FontTexture:Class;

[Embed(source="font.fnt", mimeType="application/octet-stream")]
public static const FontXml:Class;

var texture:Texture = Texture.fromEmbeddedAsset(FontTexture);
var xml:XML = XML(new FontXml());
var font:BitmapFont = new BitmapFont(texture, xml); // <1>

TextField.registerCompositor(font, font.name); // <2>
----
<1> Create an instance of the _BitmapFont_ class.
<2> Register the font at the _TextField_ class.

Once the bitmap font instance has been registered at the _TextField_ class, you don't need it any longer.
Starling will simply pick up that font when it encounters a _TextField_ that uses a font with that name.
Like here:

[source, as3]
----
var textField:TextField = new TextField(100, 20, "Hello World");
textField.format.font = "fontName"; // <1>
textField.format.size = BitmapFont.NATIVE_SIZE; // <2>
----
<1> To use the font, simply reference it by its name. By default, that's what is stored in the `face` attribute within the XML file.
<2> Bitmap fonts look best when they are displayed in the exact size that was used to create the font texture. You could assign that size manually -- but it's smarter to let Starling do that, via the `NATIVE_SIZE` constant.

==== Gotchas

There's one more thing you need to know: if your bitmap font uses just a single color (like a normal TrueType font, without any color effects), your glyphs need to be exported in pure white.
The `format.color` property of the TextField can then be used to tint the font into an arbitrary color at runtime (simply by multiplication with the RGB channels of the texture).

On the other hand, if your font does contains colors (like the sample image above), it's the TextField's `format.color` property that needs to be set to white (`Color.WHITE`).
That way, the color tinting of the TextField will not affect the texture color.

[TIP]
====
For optimal performance, you can even add bitmap fonts to your texture atlas!
That way, your texts may be batched together with regular images, reducing draw calls even more.

To do that, simply add the font's PNG image to your atlas, just like the other textures.
Then initialize the bitmap font with the _SubTexture_ from the atlas and the regular `.fnt` file.

When you support multiple scale factors (a concept we will look at in the <<Mobile Development>> chapter), the process becomes a little difficult, though.
You cannot simply create one high resolution font and have the atlas generator scale it down; this would result in occasional graphical glitches.
Each scaled font must be created separately by the bitmap font creator.
====

==== The MINI Font

Starling actually comes with one very lightweight bitmap font included.
It probably won't win any beauty contests -- but it's perfect when you need to display text in a prototype, or maybe for some debug output.

.The "MINI" bitmap font.
image::mini-font.png[BitmapFont.MINI, 396, pdfwidth='9cm', scaledwidth='396px']

When I say lightweight, I mean it: each letter is only 5 pixels high.
There is a trick, though, that will scale it up to exactly 200% its native size.

[source, as3]
----
var textField:TextField = new TextField(100, 10, "The quick brown fox ...");
textField.format.font = BitmapFont.MINI; // <1>
textField.format.size = BitmapFont.NATIVE_SIZE * 2; // <2>
----
<1> Use the MINI font.
<2> Use exactly twice the native size. Since the font uses nearest neighbor scaling, it will stay crisp!
